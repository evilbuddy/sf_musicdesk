# StarFall Music Desk

## What is SFMD ?

`SFMD` is a StarFallEx code that allows to make a simple "music" manager, via a component

## Why ?

Because it's funny. We did this long ago in E2 with a friend, now I'm updating this !

## How to use it ?

### Method 1: SF

1. Get the code 

	`loader.lua` is a loader with the latest version

	`latest.lua` contains the latest stable release

	`{Major}.{Minor}.{Patch}.lua` is a specific version

2. Place the chip
	2.1 Take the `StarFall - Processor` tool
	2.2 Right-click to open the code editor
	2.3 Paste/load the code in it
	2.4 Close the editor (`X` button)
	2.5 Left-click on the world or a prop to spawn it
3. Link a component
	2.1 Take the `StarFall - Component` tool
	2.2 Left-click on the world or a prop to spawn a screen component
	2.3 Right-click on the created screen
	2.4 Right-click on your chip to link it
4. Link a light / lights
	4.1 Spawn a **wire** light
	4.2 Take the `wire` tool

	4.5 Left-click on the option
	4.6 Left-click on the chip to link it
	*Do this for all your lights*

### Method 2: ADVDUPE2
